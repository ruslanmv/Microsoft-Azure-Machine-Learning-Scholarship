# Lab Overview

[Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-designer) (preview) gives you a cloud-based interactive, visual workspace that you can use to easily and quickly prep data, train and deploy machine learning models. It supports Azure Machine Learning compute, GPU or CPU. Machine Learning designer also supports publishing models as web services on Azure Kubernetes Service that can easily be consumed by other applications.

In this lab, we will be using the `Flight Delays` data set that is enhanced with the weather data. Based on the enriched dataset, we will learn to use the Azure Machine Learning Graphical Interface to process data, build, train, score, and evaluate a classification model to predict if a particular flight will be delayed by 15 minutes or more. The classification algorithm used in this lab will be the ensemble algorithm: **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree**. To train the model, we will use Azure Machine Learning Compute resource. We will do all of this from the Azure Machine Learning designer without writing a single line of code.
