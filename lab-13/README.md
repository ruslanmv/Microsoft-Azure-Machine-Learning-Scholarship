# Lab Overview

[Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-designer) (preview) gives you a cloud-based interactive, visual workspace that you can use to easily and quickly prep data, train and deploy machine learning models. It supports Azure Machine Learning compute, GPU or CPU. Machine Learning designer also supports publishing models as web services on Azure Kubernetes Service that can easily be consumed by other applications.

In this lab, we will be using the `Weather Dataset` that has weather data for 66 different airports in the USA from April to October 2013. We will cluster the dataset into 5 distinct clusters based on key weather metrics, such as visibility, temperature, dew point, wind speed etc. The goal is to group airports with similar weather conditions. We will do all of this from the Azure Machine Learning designer without writing a single line of code.

# Exercise 1: Create New Training Pipeline

3. From the results you can observe that each row (input) in the dataset is assigned to one of the 5 clusters: 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. You can also see for each input, how far that input was from the various centroids. The cluster assignment is made based on the shortest distance between the input and cluster centroids. From the bar graph you can see the frequency distribution of all the inputs across the 5 clusters.

# Next Steps
Congratulations! You have trained and evaluated your first clustering algorithm. You can continue to experiment in the environment but are free to close the lab environment tab and return to the Udacity portal to continue with the lesson.
