# Train a simple recommender

The main aim of a recommendation system is to recommend one or more items to users of the system. Examples of an item to be recommended, might be a movie, restaurant, book, or song. In general, the user is an entity with item preferences such as a person, a group of persons, or any other type of entity you can imagine.

There are two principal approaches to recommender systems:

- The `content-based` approach, which makes use of features for both users and items. Users can be described by properties such as age or gender. Items can be described by properties such as the author or the manufacturer. Typical examples of content-based recommendation systems can be found on social matchmaking sites.
- The `Collaborative filtering` approach, which uses only identifiers of the users and the items. It is based on a matrix of ratings given by the users to the items. The main source of information about a user is the list the items they've rated and the similarity with other users who have rated the same items.

The SVD recommender module in Azure Machine Learning designer is based on the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm. It uses identifiers of the users and the items, and a matrix of ratings given by the users to the items. It's a typical example of collaborative recommender.

## Lab Overview

In this lab, we make use of the Train SVD Recommender module available in Azure Machine Learning designer (preview), to train a movie recommender engine. We use the collaborative filtering approach: the model learns from a collection of ratings made by users on a subset of a catalog of movies. Two open datasets available in Azure Machine Learning designer are used the `IMDB Movie Titles` dataset joined on the movie identifier with the `Movie Ratings` dataset.
The Movie Ratings data consists of approximately 225,000 ratings for 15,742 movies by 26,770 users, extracted from Twitter using techniques described in the original paper by Dooms, De Pessemier and Martens. The paper and data can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/sidooms/MovieTweetings).

We will both train the engine and score new data, to demonstrate the different modes in which a recommender can be used and evaluated.
The trained model will predict what rating a user will give to unseen movies, so we'll be able to recommend movies that the user is most likely to enjoy. We will do all of this from the Azure Machine Learning designer without writing a single line of code.

## Exercise 1: Create New Training Pipeline

2. Select **Edit code** to open the `Python script` editor, clear the existing code and then enter the following lines of code to select the UserId, Movie Name, Rating columns from the joined dataset. Please ensure that there is no indentation for the first line and the second and third lines are indented.

    ```python
    def azureml_main(dataframe1 = None, dataframe2 = None):
        df1 = dataframe1[['UserId','Movie Name','Rating']]
        return df1,
    ```

    > Note: In other pipelines, for selecting a list of columns from a dataset, we could have used the `Select Columns from Dataset` prebuilt module. This one returns the columns in the same order as in the input dataset. This time we need the output dataset to be in the format: user id, movie name, rating.This column order is required at the input of the Train SVD Recommender module.

    3. Connect the first output of the `Split Data` module to the input of the `Train SVD Recommender` module

    4. Number of factors: **200**. This option specify the number of factors to use with the recommender. With the number of users and items increasing, it's better to set a larger number of factors. But if the number is too large, performance might drop.

    5. Number of recommendation algorithm iterations: **30**. This number indicates how many times the algorithm should process the input data. The higher this number is, the more accurate the predictions are. However, a higher number means slower training. The default value is 30.

    6. For Learning rate: **0.001**. The learning rate defines the step size for learning.
