# Lab Overview

[Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-designer) (preview) gives you a cloud-based interactive, visual workspace that you can use to easily and quickly prep data, train and deploy machine learning models. It supports Azure Machine Learning compute, GPU or CPU. Machine Learning designer also supports publishing models as web services on Azure Kubernetes Service that can easily be consumed by other applications.

In this lab, we will be compare the performance of two binary classifiers: Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree and Two-Class Logistic Regression for predicting customer churn. The goal is to run an expensive marketing campaign for high risk customers; thus, the **precision** metric is going to be key in evaluating performance of these two algorithms. We will do all of this from the Azure Machine Learning designer without writing a single line of code.

# Exercise 1: Create Training Pipeline

## Task 1: Open Sample 5: Binary Classification – Customer Relationship Prediction

1. In [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), open the available machine learning workspace.

2. Select **Launch now** under the **Try the new Azure Machine Learning studio** message.

    ![Launch Azure Machine Learning studio.](images/01a.png 'Launch AML')

3. When you first launch the studio, you may need to set the directory and subscription. If so, you will see this screen:

    ![Launch Azure Machine Learning studio.](images/00.png 'Launch AML')

    > For the directory, select **Udacity** and for the subscription, select **Azure Sponsorship**. For the machine learning workspace, you may see multiple options listed. **Select any of these** (it doesn't matter which) and then click **Get started**.

4. From the studio, select **Designer, Sample 5: Binary Classification – Customer Relationship Prediction**.

## Task 3: Delete Pipeline Modules

1. From the `right-hand-side` of the pipeline, select the **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree module** and then select the **Delete Icon**.

## Task 4: Setup the Two-Class Logistic Regression Module

1. Select **Machine Learning Algorithms** section in the left navigation. Follow the steps outlined below:

    1. Select the **Two-Class Logistic Regression** prebuilt module

    2. Drag and drop the selected module on to the canvas

    3. Connect the `Two-Class Logistic Regression` module to the first input of the `Train Model` module

    4. Connect the first output of the `Split Data` module to the second input of the `Train Model` module

    ![Image shows the steps to add and configure the Two-Class Logistic Regression module.](images/13.png 'Two-Class Logistic Regression Module')

# Exercise 2: Submit Training Pipeline

## Task 1: Create Experiment and Submit Pipeline

1. Select **Submit** to open the `Setup pipeline run` editor.

    ![Image shows where to select the submit button to open the setup pipeline run editor.](images/07.png 'Submit Pipeline')

    > Please note that the button name in the UI is changed from **Run** to **Submit**.

2. In the `Setup pipeline run editor`, select **Experiment, Create new** and provide `New experiment name:` **Churn-Predictor**, and then select **Submit**.

    ![Image shows how to provide the experiment name in the setup pipeline run editor and start the pipeline run.](images/08.png 'Submit Pipeline')

3. Wait for pipeline run to complete. It will take around **5 minutes** to complete the run.

4. While you wait for the model training to complete, you can learn more about the evaluation metrics for the classification algorithm used in this lab by selecting [Metrics for classification models](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-module-reference/evaluate-model#bkmk_classification).

# Exercise 3: Compare Model Performance

## Task 1: Open Evaluation Results for Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree

1. From the `left-hand-side` of the pipeline, select **Evaluate Model, Outputs, Visualize** to open the `Evaluate Model result visualization` dialog for the `Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree` module.

    ![Image shows how to open the evaluate model result visualization dialog.](images/09.png 'Evaluate Model Results')

## Task 2: Evaluate Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree Performance

1. Scroll down to review model performance metrics for `Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree`. Observe that the **Precision** value is around **0.7**.

    ![Image shows the evaluate model result visualization dialog for Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree.](images/10.png 'Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree Performance')

## Task 3: Open Evaluation Results for Two-Class Logistic Regression

1. From the `right-hand-side` of the pipeline, select **Evaluate Model, Outputs, Visualize** to open the `Evaluate Model result visualization` dialog for the `Two-Class Logistic Regression` module.

    ![Image shows how to open the evaluate model result visualization dialog.](images/11.png 'Evaluate Model Results')

## Task 4: Evaluate Two-Class Logistic Regression Performance

1. Scroll down to review model performance metrics for `Two-Class Logistic Regression`. Observe that the **Precision** value is around **0.3**.

    ![Image shows the evaluate model result visualization dialog for Two-Class Logistic Regression.](images/12.png 'Two-Class Logistic Regression Performance')

## Task 5: Conclusion

1. Based on the primary performance metric, `Precision`, it shows that the `Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree` algorithm outperforms the `Two-Class Logistic Regression` algorithm.

# Next Steps
