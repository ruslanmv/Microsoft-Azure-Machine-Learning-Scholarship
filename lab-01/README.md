# Lab Overview

[Azure Machine Learning designer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-designer) (preview) gives you a cloud-based interactive, visual workspace that you can use to easily and quickly prep data, train and deploy machine learning models. It supports Azure Machine Learning compute, GPU or CPU. Machine Learning designer also supports publishing models as web services on Azure Kubernetes Service that can easily be consumed by other applications.

In this lab, we will be using a subset of NYC Taxi & Limousine Commission - green taxi trip records available from [Azure Open Datasets](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/open-datasets/). The data is enriched with holiday and weather data. Based on the enriched dataset, we will learn to use the Azure Machine Learning Graphical Interface to process data, build, train, score, and evaluate a regression model to predict NYC taxi fares. To train the model, we will create Azure Machine Learning Compute resource. We will do all of this from the Azure Machine Learning designer without writing a single line of code.

# Exercise 1: Register Dataset with Azure Machine Learning studio

    3. Fraction of rows in the first output dataset: **0.7**

    4. Connect the `Dataset` to the `Split Data` module

    ![Image shows the steps to add and configure the Split Data module.](images/13.png 'Split Data Module')

*Note that you can submit the pipeline at any point to peek at the outputs and activities. Running pipeline also generates metadata that is available for downstream activities such selecting column names from a list in selection dialogs.*

## Task 5: Initialize Regression Model
